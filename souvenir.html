 <br>
 Suddenly, Thor’s eyes fill with electricity and lightning sparks from his fingers. 
 <br>
 his powers were fully awakened at last. Thor then hits his sister with “the biggest lightning blast
 <br>
  in the history of lightning blasts,” and flies to the rainbow bridge.

  <br>
  it was repurposed by Tony Stark and Bruce Banner,
  <br>
 who uploaded the remnants of Stark's personal A.I. J.A.R.V.I.S. into it.
 <br>
 while in between fighting ,THOR came and unleashed his power and VISION was born.

  <br>
  Across the arena, the door begins to open and who should appear before Thor but the Hulk.
  <br>
   The Asgardian then shocks the crowd by shouting “YES!” at the top of his voice 
   <br>
   before declaring to the Grandmaster that he’s a friend from work.

  <h2 style="color:  rgb(211, 192, 139)" align="left">I went for the head!</h2>
  <br>
  Thor has had enough and decides that this time, he’ll aim for the head. 
  <br>
  In one swing of Stormbreaker, Thor decapitates the villain and gives himself 
  <br>
  some closure from the battle of Wakanda.

  <br>
  As Captain America summons the hammer into his hands,
  <br>
   Thor gleefully exclaims, “I knew it!”

  <br>
  Thor being burnt in the forge at Nidavellir when forging Stormbreaker is 
  <br>
  also an allusion to him being reborn (reforged) as well, making him stronger 
  <br>
  and able to seriously hurt Thanos
